# SharpDash
A collection of utility functions for .Net

Tired of creating and re-creating extension methods, subclassing native types for additional functionality etc? Welcome to SharpDash.
It was inspired by Lodash, a Javascript utility library, and the goal is to create more abstractions that would allow .Net developers to write better code with fewer lines.

More info coming...
